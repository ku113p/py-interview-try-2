# Marketing Foundations

Strategic foundations for positioning, messaging, and growth. This document answers "why" and "for whom" before any tactical execution.

**Relationship to other files:** Tactical materials (landing pages, Reddit posts, outreach scripts) live in `stage-1-validation/`. This document provides the strategic layer they build on.

## 1. Core Value Proposition

### One-Line

**"Make any AI actually know you."**

### The Problem (Universal)

AI is powerful but starts every session knowing nothing about you. The result:

- You copy-paste context, repeat your background, re-explain your situation
- AI gives generic advice because it has generic knowledge of you
- Your knowledge is scattered across chat logs, documents, notes — none of it accessible to AI
- Every new AI tool means starting from zero again

This isn't a developer problem or a job seeker problem. It's everyone's problem.

### The Solution

- **Structured interviews** extract deep knowledge about any topic you choose
- Knowledge is stored, indexed, and searchable
- **Any AI** connected via MCP can access it — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, any tool
- Interview once, benefit everywhere, every session

### Why Interviews, Not Passive Capture

Passive memory tools (Mem0, Zep) grab fragments from conversations: "user likes Python," "user lives in Berlin." This is like overhearing someone at a party.

Interviews go deep: your projects, decisions, context, accomplishments, reasoning. This is like sitting down with someone and asking real questions for 30 minutes.

| | Passive Capture | Structured Interview |
|---|---|---|
| **Depth** | Surface fragments | Deep, structured knowledge |
| **Coverage** | Random (whatever comes up) | Systematic (guided by topic areas) |
| **Quality** | "User mentioned Python" | "User led a Python migration at Acme Corp, reducing deploy time by 40%" |
| **Effort** | Zero (runs in background) | 15-30 minutes per topic |
| **Result** | Slightly better autocomplete | AI that genuinely understands your background |

The effort is the feature: spending 30 minutes being interviewed produces knowledge that passive tools never capture.

## 2. Use Cases & Client Groups

### Full Use Case Map

| Use Case | Who | Pain Point | Concrete Output | Market Size | Pain Intensity | Willingness to Pay |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Career / CV** | Job seekers, professionals | Can't articulate accomplishments; resume takes hours; career coaches cost $200-700 | ATS-optimized CV, cover letters, interview prep | Very large (millions actively job seeking) | High (time-sensitive, career impact) | High ($12-79 one-time) |
| **AI Personalization** | AI power users, developers | AI gives generic responses; no persistent context across sessions | Personalized AI in every session via MCP | Medium (growing fast with MCP adoption) | Medium (daily annoyance, not urgent) | Medium ($29/mo for power users) |
| **Consulting / Freelance** | Consultants, freelancers | Need to document projects, skills, client history for proposals and portfolios | Portfolio content, proposal drafts, case studies | Medium (tens of millions globally) | Medium (ongoing need, revenue-linked) | Medium-High (business expense) |
| **Research / Academic** | Researchers, PhD students | Knowledge scattered across papers, notes, experiments; hard to synthesize | Structured research knowledge base; literature connections | Medium (millions of researchers) | Medium (career-important but slow burn) | Low-Medium (budget-constrained) |
| **Personal Knowledge** | Knowledge workers, lifelong learners | Forget what you know; can't find old decisions or reasoning | Searchable personal knowledge base accessible by any AI | Large (anyone who thinks for a living) | Low-Medium (nice-to-have for most) | Low (hard to justify subscription) |
| **Onboarding / Teams** | Team leads, HR, managers | New hires need months to learn tribal knowledge; knowledge leaves with employees | Captured institutional knowledge; onboarding acceleration | Large (every company) | High (expensive problem) | High (but requires B2B sales) |
| **Health / Life** | Health-conscious individuals | Hard to articulate medical history; track progress across providers | Structured health timeline; provider-ready summaries | Large (everyone has health history) | Variable (high during health events) | Low-Medium (privacy concerns dominant) |

### Priority Segments for Stage 1

**Test first (top 2):**

1. **Career / CV** — Highest combination of market size, pain intensity, and willingness to pay. Genuine whitespace (no competitor does conversational CV generation). Most concrete demo: talk for 15 minutes → get a PDF. Easiest to validate.

2. **AI Personalization (MCP)** — Smaller market but higher per-user value and recurring revenue. Growing with MCP ecosystem. Natural upsell from CV users who discover the knowledge layer.

**Test in Stage 2-3 if traction:**

3. **Consulting / Freelance** — Natural extension of career use case. Same knowledge extraction, different output (proposals instead of CVs). Could become a distinct segment if consultants respond strongly.

**Defer:**

4-7 are all valid but harder to validate quickly. Research/academic has budget constraints. Personal knowledge is too vague for marketing. Onboarding requires B2B sales motion. Health raises privacy concerns that slow adoption.

**The key insight:** CV is the **most concrete demonstration** of the core value. MCP is the **delivery mechanism** that makes it universal. But the product serves anyone who wants AI that truly understands them. Don't build yourself into a "resume tool" corner.

## 3. Founder Story

### The Narrative

> AI can do anything — write code, analyze data, draft emails, plan projects. But it knows nothing about YOU.
>
> Every conversation starts from zero. You paste your background, re-explain your projects, remind it of your preferences. And then the session ends and it forgets everything again.
>
> I kept thinking: isn't there a better way? What if you just spent 30 minutes being interviewed — really interviewed, with follow-up questions and structured topics — and then any AI tool you use knows about you? Not just "user likes Python" but actually understands your career, your projects, your decisions, your expertise?
>
> That's what I built. Interview Assistant interviews you like a good colleague would, extracts structured knowledge, and makes it available to any AI via MCP. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini — they all get access to who you really are.
>
> The first thing I built with it was CV generation. Talk for 15 minutes about your career, get a professional resume out. But that's just one output. The real value is: any AI you use, in any context, actually knows you.

### Where to Use This

- **Reddit posts:** Open with the "aha moment" paragraph (the "isn't there a better way?" part)
- **Landing page "About" section:** Full version
- **Outreach DMs:** Condensed to 2-3 sentences
- **Demo video intro:** 15-second version

### Condensed Versions

**Two sentences (for DMs/comments):**
> AI is powerful but knows nothing about you. I built a tool that interviews you about any topic — then any AI you use via MCP actually knows your background, your projects, your expertise.

**One sentence (for bios/taglines):**
> Structured interviews that make any AI actually know you.

## 4. Value Quantification

### Career / CV Use Case

| Metric | Without Interview Assistant | With Interview Assistant | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to create resume | 4-8 hours (manual) | 15-30 minutes (interview) | **Save 3.5-7.5 hours** |
| Career coach session | $200-700 per session | $12/mo or $79 lifetime | **Save $120-690** |
| Resume quality | Self-written (misses accomplishments) | AI-extracted (structured, ATS-optimized) | **Better quality** |
| Cover letter per application | 30-60 minutes each | 2-3 minutes (AI generates from knowledge) | **Save 25-55 min/application** |
| Updates over time | Rewrite from scratch | Re-interview, auto-regenerate | **Ongoing time savings** |

**Bottom line for CV:** $79 lifetime replaces a $200-700 career coach. Pays for itself on the first use.

### AI Personalization (MCP) Use Case

| Metric | Without Interview Assistant | With Interview Assistant | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Context setup per session | 2-5 minutes copy-pasting background | Zero (MCP serves context automatically) | **Save 2-5 min/session** |
| Sessions per day (power user) | 5-15 | 5-15 | — |
| Monthly time saved | 3-11 hours/month | — | **3-11 hours/month** |
| Response quality | Generic (AI guesses about you) | Personalized (AI knows your real background) | **Qualitatively better** |
| Works across tools | Must re-paste in each tool | One interview, all MCP tools get access | **Universal access** |

**Bottom line for MCP:** At $29/mo, that's $2.60-9.60/hr for time saved — plus qualitatively better AI responses in every session.

### Consulting / Freelance Use Case

| Metric | Without | With | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proposal drafting | 2-4 hours (recall projects, format) | 30 min (AI pulls from knowledge base) | **Save 1.5-3.5 hours/proposal** |
| Portfolio maintenance | Never up to date | Auto-generated from interviews | **Always current** |
| Client onboarding docs | Written from scratch each time | Generated from structured project history | **Save 1-2 hours/client** |

## 5. Complete Objection Map

### Objection 1: "I'll just use ChatGPT / Claude directly"

**Concern:** "I can paste my background into ChatGPT and get the same thing."

**Response:** You can — for one session. Then it's gone. And you'll paste a different subset next time. Interview Assistant does a structured, guided interview that extracts things you'd never think to paste (accomplishments you've forgotten, project context, decision reasoning). And it works across every AI tool, every session, forever.

**Proof point:** Show side-by-side: ChatGPT with pasted background vs. ChatGPT with MCP access to full interview data. The depth difference is obvious.

### Objection 2: "How is this different from Mem0 / Zep?"

**Concern:** "There are already AI memory tools."

**Response:** Mem0 and Zep capture fragments passively from conversations — "user likes Python," "user is in Berlin." Interview Assistant conducts structured interviews that go deep on specific topics. It's the difference between someone overhearing you at a party vs. a colleague sitting down and asking you real questions. The knowledge quality is fundamentally different.

**Proof point:** Compare actual stored data: Mem0 fragments vs. Interview Assistant's structured knowledge entries.

### Objection 3: "Is the CV ATS-friendly?"

**Concern:** "Auto-generated resumes get rejected by applicant tracking systems."

**Response:** Yes. CV generation uses clean, parseable formatting designed for ATS systems. No tables, no columns, no graphics that break parsing — just structured, keyword-optimized content extracted from your actual experience.

**Proof point:** Run generated CV through free ATS checker tools, show score.

### Objection 4: "I don't want to talk to a bot"

**Concern:** "Chatbots are annoying. I don't want to have a fake conversation."

**Response:** Fair — most chatbots are terrible. This isn't small talk. It's structured questions about your real experience, with follow-ups that go deeper. Think of it less like "chatbot" and more like "guided questionnaire that adapts to your answers." Most users report that after 2-3 questions they forget they're talking to a bot because the questions are genuinely relevant to their work.

**Proof point:** Demo video showing a real interview flow — the questions are substantive, not scripted small talk.

### Objection 5: "What happens to my data?"

**Concern:** "I don't trust a service with my personal/career information."

**Response:** Three options depending on your comfort level:
1. **Hosted service:** Data encrypted at rest, never shared, never used for training. Delete anytime.
2. **Self-hosted:** Run the entire system on your own infrastructure. Your data never leaves your machine.
3. **Local-only:** Use the CLI interface with local storage. Zero network dependency.

**Proof point:** Open-source codebase — you can verify exactly what happens to your data. Self-hosted tier exists specifically for privacy-conscious users.

### Objection 6: "Why pay when free tools exist?"

**Concern:** "ChatGPT has memory now. Claude has Projects. Why do I need this?"

**Response:** Built-in AI memory is shallow and siloed. ChatGPT remembers fragments from your chats — but only in ChatGPT. Claude Projects hold documents — but only in Claude. Interview Assistant creates structured knowledge that works across every AI tool via MCP. One interview session, every AI benefits. And the interview process extracts knowledge you'd never generate in normal chat.

**Proof point:** Show the same knowledge being used in Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor simultaneously.

### Objection 7: "Sounds cool but I don't actually need this"

**Concern:** The "nice to have" problem — interesting but not urgent.

**Response (for CV segment):** If you're job searching, you need a resume. That's not optional. The question is whether you spend 6 hours writing one or 15 minutes being interviewed. This isn't "nice to have" — it's "save an entire Saturday."

**Response (for MCP segment):** If you use AI daily, you're already wasting 2-5 minutes per session re-establishing context. That's 1-2 hours per week. Over a year, that's 50-100 hours. This solves that permanently.

**Proof point:** Value quantification (Section 4). Make the math concrete and personal.

## 6. Pricing Strategy

### Current Pricing

| Tier | Price | Target | Core Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | Everyone | 1 interview + 1 CV generation |
| **CV Pro** | $12/mo or $79 lifetime | Job seekers, professionals | Unlimited interviews + CV generations, ATS-optimized export |
| **Knowledge Pro** | $29/mo | AI power users, developers | Everything in CV Pro + MCP server access for any AI tool |
| **Self-Hosted** | $59/mo | Privacy-conscious, enterprise | Everything in Knowledge Pro + Docker deployment, full source |

### Value-Based Justification

**Free tier ($0):**
- Purpose: Remove friction. Let people experience the interview + CV generation without commitment.
- Limit: 1 interview + 1 CV. Enough to see the value, not enough for ongoing use.
- Goal: 5-10% conversion to paid within 30 days.

**CV Pro ($12/mo or $79 lifetime):**
- Replaces: Career coach ($200-700/session), resume writing service ($100-400)
- At $12/mo: Pays for itself if you apply to even one job per month (saves hours on cover letters)
- At $79 lifetime: Less than half the cost of the cheapest career coach session. One-time payment for unlimited use.
- Why $79 lifetime: Job seekers are transient — they'll churn after finding a job. Capture maximum value upfront. $79 is an impulse purchase for someone actively job hunting who just spent $200 on a resume service.

**Knowledge Pro ($29/mo):**
- Replaces: Hours of context-setting per week across AI tools
- At ~$1/day: Cheaper than a coffee, saves 30+ minutes daily for power users
- Why subscription not lifetime: MCP users get recurring daily value (unlike job seekers who are transient). Subscription matches the value pattern.
- Why $29 not $19: Technical users who use AI daily have higher willingness to pay. $29 is still well under the threshold for "business expense I don't think about."

**Self-Hosted ($59/mo):**
- Replaces: Building your own system (weeks of engineering time)
- Premium for full source access and Docker deployment
- Targets privacy-conscious individuals and small teams
- Why higher than Knowledge Pro: Self-hosted users are paying for trust and control, not just features.

### Payment Methods

1. **Polar.sh** (primary) — Credit card, Apple Pay. 4% + $0.40 per transaction. No entity required.
2. **USDC on Base** (privacy option) — ~$0.01 gas. For crypto-native users who prefer privacy.
3. **NOWPayments** (if 10+ crypto customers) — 0.5% fee. Multi-crypto support.

## 7. Retention & Conversion Plan

### Free → Paid Conversion

**Conversion target:** 5-10% of free users convert within 30 days.

**Triggers that drive upgrade:**

| Trigger | Timing | Message |
|---|---|---|
| Free CV generated | Immediately after | "Your CV is ready! Upgrade to CV Pro for unlimited updates and ATS optimization." |
| Free interview limit hit | When they try a second interview | "You've used your free interview. CV Pro gives you unlimited interviews for $12/mo." |
| 7 days after signup | Email / notification | "You generated a CV last week. Job applications going well? CV Pro lets you generate tailored versions for each application." |
| 14 days after signup | Email / notification | "Quick question — did the CV help? Reply and let me know. PS: $79 lifetime gets you unlimited everything." |

**Email sequence (4 emails over 14 days):**

1. **Day 0 (signup):** Welcome + how to get the most from your free interview. No sell.
2. **Day 3:** "Here's what CV Pro users do differently" — show use cases (multiple CV versions, cover letters, interview prep). Soft CTA.
3. **Day 7:** Social proof (when available) + $79 lifetime offer. Direct CTA.
4. **Day 14:** "Last check-in" — ask for feedback. Mention lifetime deal is available. Final CTA.

### Why Users Stay (Retention Drivers)

**CV Pro users:**
- Career is ongoing — new jobs, promotions, role changes require CV updates
- Cover letter generation for each application (recurring need during job search)
- Interview prep from knowledge base
- Risk: Churn after finding a job. Mitigation: Lifetime tier captures value upfront.

**Knowledge Pro users:**
- Daily value — every AI session is better with MCP access
- Knowledge compounds over time (more interviews = richer knowledge base)
- Switching cost — once your knowledge is in the system, moving is painful
- Risk: MCP ecosystem changes. Mitigation: Multi-protocol support, stay current with standards.

### Churn Signals & Interventions

| Signal | Meaning | Intervention |
|---|---|---|
| No login for 14 days | Forgot about it or lost interest | Email: "Your knowledge base has X entries. Here's what you can do with it." |
| No new interviews for 30 days | Got initial value, stopped exploring | Email: "Have you tried interviewing about [new topic area]? Users who cover 3+ areas see the biggest difference." |
| Support ticket / complaint | Something is broken or confusing | Priority response within 24 hours. Offer help call. |
| Cancellation initiated | About to churn | Exit survey: "What would make you stay?" Offer 1 month free or lifetime discount. |

### Funnel Targets

| Stage | Target | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Visitor → Signup | 15-25% | Landing page conversion rate |
| Signup → Free Interview | 50-70% | Activation rate |
| Free → Paid (30 days) | 5-10% | Conversion rate |
| Paid → 3-month retention | 70-80% | Retention rate |
| Customer → Referral | 10-20% | Referral rate |
