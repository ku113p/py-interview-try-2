# Market Segmentation Analysis

## UPDATE (2026-02-24): CV Segment Is Primary

Based on market research (see [REVIEW-2026-02-24.md](./REVIEW-2026-02-24.md)):
- **"Conversational CV generation" is genuine whitespace** - zero competitors do this
- The closest analog is a $200-700 human career coach
- MCP memory space has real competitors (Mem0, Zep AI) - harder to differentiate
- Job seekers are a much larger market ($1.5-2.5B)

**Strategy update:** Lead with CV segment. MCP is the premium upsell.

## Two Market Segments (CV Primary, MCP Secondary)

---

## Segment A: Career Professionals (Lower Risk, Broader Market)

### Target Audience
- Job seekers updating resumes
- Professionals preparing for interviews
- Consultants/freelancers managing portfolios
- Anyone who hates resume formatting

### Value Proposition

### Why Lower Risk?
✅ **Larger market** - millions of job seekers globally
✅ **Clear outcome** - CV generation is tangible deliverable
✅ **Easy to understand** - no technical setup required
✅ **Proven need** - people pay for resume services already
✅ **No technical barrier** - just use Telegram bot

## Segment B: MCP Power Users (Higher Risk, Higher Value)

### Target Audience
- Developers using Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf
- ChatGPT power users wanting memory
- Early adopters of MCP protocol
- AI enthusiasts building workflows

### Value Proposition
**"Give ANY AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor) long-term memory via MCP."**

### Why Higher Risk?
⚠️ **Smaller market** - MCP is still early/niche
⚠️ **Technical setup required** - config files, API keys
⚠️ **Uncertain adoption** - users might be afraid of MCP complexity
⚠️ **Protocol risk** - MCP could change or fail to gain traction

### Why Higher Value?
✅ **Recurring use** - daily value (every AI conversation)
✅ **Lower churn** - becomes part of workflow
✅ **Network effects** - MCP ecosystem growing
✅ **Premium pricing** - technical users pay more

### Marketing Channels
- r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA, r/ChatGPT (Reddit)
- MCP GitHub Discussions
- Claude/OpenAI Discord servers
- Cursor/Windsurf communities
- AI Twitter

### Messaging
"AI assistants forget everything after each chat. Interview Assistant is an MCP server that gives Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible AI long-term memory. 5-minute setup. Works today. $19-39/month."

### Conversion Path
1. See post about MCP memory solution
2. Watch demo video (MCP setup → AI queries knowledge)
3. Sign up for early access
4. Follow setup guide (add to config file)
5. Test query in their AI assistant

**CV generation is a bonus, MCP is the hero.**

## Recommended Strategy: Test Both, Pivot Based on Data

### Week 1-2: Create Materials for Both Segments
- **Demo Video A:** CV generation focus (non-technical)
- **Demo Video B:** MCP setup focus (technical)
- **Landing Page:** Two sections addressing both audiences

### Week 2-3: Post in Both Types of Communities
- Track signups per segment
- Note which messaging resonates
- Measure engagement quality

### Week 3-4: Analyze Results
| Metric | Career Segment | MCP Segment |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Signups | ? | ? |
| "How do I pay?" inquiries | ? | ? |
| Technical questions | ? | ? |
| Conversion rate | ? | ? |

### Decision Framework

**If Career Segment Wins (10:1 signups):**
- Make CV generation the hero feature
- MCP becomes "Pro" tier bonus
- Marketing: "AI-powered resume assistant"
- Larger market, easier onboarding

**If MCP Segment Wins (1:1 or better):**
- Make MCP the hero feature
- CV generation becomes "included" feature
- Marketing: "Give AI long-term memory"
- Smaller but premium market

**If Both Convert Well:**
- Keep dual positioning
- Two tiers: "CV Pro" ($19) and "MCP + CV" ($39)
- Different marketing materials per audience

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk: MCP users scared of technical setup**
- **Mitigation:** Offer 5-minute video tutorial, copy-paste config
- **Pivot:** If too complex, focus on CV segment

**Risk: CV market too commoditized**
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize conversational UX (no typing!) and privacy
- **Pivot:** Focus on MCP segment if CV doesn't convert

**Risk: Neither segment converts**
- **Mitigation:** Interview non-converters to learn objections
- **Pivot:** Try different angle (consultants? students? researchers?)

---

## Success Metrics (Stage 1)

**Minimum Viable Proof:**
- 20+ signups TOTAL (from either or both segments)
- 5+ direct payment inquiries
- 3+ people saying "$15-40 is reasonable"

**Ideal Proof:**
- 30+ signups (15+ in one clear winning segment)
- 10+ payment inquiries
- 5+ people saying "I'd pay today if available"

**Segment identification:**
- Clear 2:1 ratio favoring one segment
- OR both converting equally (dual positioning works)
