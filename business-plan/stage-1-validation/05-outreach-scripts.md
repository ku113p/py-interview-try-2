# Outreach & DM Scripts

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use templates for engaging with potential customers
**Usage:** Customize with your details, use for Reddit DMs, email, Telegram
**Goal:** Convert interest → waitlist signup → paying customer

---

## Script 1: Waitlist Confirmation Email

**When:** Someone signs up via landing page
**Goal:** Confirm signup, set expectations, start conversation

**Subject:** You're on the list! (Interview Assistant early access)

```
Hi [name],

Thanks for joining the waitlist!

You're #[number] in line for early access. Planning to launch Q2 2026,
but doing small beta group starting [DATE].

Quick question while I have you: What would you primarily use this for?
- Cover letters / job applications
- Interview prep
- Knowledge search
- Something else?

Helps me prioritize what to build first.

We accept credit cards, Apple Pay, and crypto (USDC/BTC) for payments.

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. Reply anytime with questions. I read every email.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Confirms they're on list (sets expectations)
- Asks qualifying question (learns use case)
- Mentions payment options (credit cards + crypto)
- Invites conversation (builds relationship)

---

## Script 2: Response to Reddit Comment (Positive)

**When:** Someone comments positively on your post ("This is cool!", "Would use this")
**Goal:** Move from public comment to private DM

**Reply in thread:**
```
Thanks! Glad it resonates.

If you want to try it before public launch, I'm doing early access
starting next month. DM me if interested—happy to set up test account.
```

**Then send DM:**
```
Hey! Saw your comment on my Interview Assistant post.

Doing small early access group (10-15 people) starting [DATE].
Would you be up for trying it? Looking for honest feedback more
than anything.

Details:
- $12/mo for CV, $29/mo for full platform
- First month free if you give feedback
- Cancel anytime, no commitment

Let me know if you're interested and I'll add you to the list!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Moves conversation to DM (more personal)
- Offers early access (creates urgency)
- First month free (lowers barrier)
- Emphasizes feedback (not just selling)

---

## Script 3: Response to Critical Feedback

**When:** Someone posts criticism ("Too expensive", "Why not just use X?", "Seems overcomplicated")
**Goal:** Learn from objection, possibly convert skeptic

**Reply in thread:**
```
Good point. Mind if I ask what price would seem fair to you?
(Genuinely trying to figure out pricing, all feedback helps.)

Re: [their concern], you're right that [acknowledge their point].
The way I'm thinking about it is [your counter-argument], but
I could be wrong. What would make this a no-brainer for you?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Doesn't get defensive
- Asks questions (learns from objection)
- Acknowledges their concern (shows you're listening)
- Opens dialogue (might convert them)

**Follow-up DM (if conversation goes well):**
```
Thanks for the feedback on my post. Super helpful.

Based on what you said, wondering if you'd be interested in early
access at a lower price point ($12/mo range)? Since you clearly
understand the space, your feedback would be really valuable.

No pressure—just thought I'd ask since we were already talking.
```

---

## Script 4: Direct Outreach (Cold DM)

**When:** You see someone in community complaining about problem you solve
**Goal:** Introduce yourself, offer solution, avoid being spammy

**Example: Someone posts "How do you keep Claude from forgetting everything?"**

**DM Template:**
```
Hey [name],

Saw your question about Claude memory. I actually just built something
for this—MCP server that stores conversational interviews and lets
Claude search them later.

Not sure if it's exactly what you need, but figured I'd reach out
since your question was super relevant.

Quick demo: [link]

Would you be interested in trying it? Still rough but core features work.
Happy to set up test account if you want to experiment.

No worries if not—just thought it might help!
```

**Why This Works:**
- References their specific problem (shows you read their post)
- Offers solution without being pushy
- Provides demo link (easy to check out)
- Gives them out ("no worries if not")

---

## Script 5: Follow-Up After Demo

**When:** Someone watched your demo or visited landing page but didn't sign up
**Goal:** Re-engage, address concerns, convert to waitlist

**Email/DM:**
```
Hey [name],

Saw you checked out the Interview Assistant demo. Curious what you
thought—did it click or was something confusing?

I'm refining the pitch based on feedback, so any reaction (even
"not for me because X") is super helpful.

If you're interested but not ready to commit, I can add you to
early access list. Planning to offer first month free for beta users.

Either way, appreciate you taking a look!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Low-pressure (just asking for feedback)
- Offers early access with incentive (first month free)
- Invites objections (helps you learn)

---

## Script 6: Pre-Sale Conversion

**When:** Someone expressed interest but hasn't paid yet
**Goal:** Convert waitlist → paying customer

**Email:**
```
Subject: Ready to try Interview Assistant?

Hi [name],

You signed up for Interview Assistant waitlist a few weeks ago.

Good news: I'm opening 10 early access spots this week.

Here's the deal:
- $12/mo for CV access, $29/mo for AI memory (credit card or crypto)
- First 2 weeks free (try before committing)
- Cancel anytime, no questions asked
- Direct support via Telegram/email (you're talking to the founder)

If you're interested, just reply "yes" and I'll send payment instructions.

If timing's not right, no worries—I'll reach out again at public launch.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear CTA ("reply yes")
- First 2 weeks free (reduces risk)
- Direct support from founder (personal touch)
- Easy out (timing not right)

---

## Script 7: Response to Price Objection

**When:** Someone says "Too expensive" or asks for discount
**Goal:** Understand their budget, possibly offer alternative

**DM:**
```
Totally understand. What price point would work for you?

I'm still figuring out pricing based on feedback. If $12 is too steep,
would something like $10-12 make sense? Or is the value prop just not
there yet?

Also curious: what do you currently use for [their use case]? Trying
to understand what I'm competing against.
```

**If they suggest reasonable price:**
```
Got it. Tell you what—if you want to try it at $[their price] for
first 3 months, I'm down. You'd be helping me validate the product,
so that's worth the discount.

Interested?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Doesn't reject immediately (explores compromise)
- Learns their budget and use case
- Offers discount tied to value (beta feedback)

---

## Script 8: Renewal Reminder

**When:** Customer's subscription expires in 3-5 days
**Goal:** Get them to renew, understand why if they don't

**Email:**
```
Subject: Your Interview Assistant subscription expires soon

Hi [name],

Just a heads up: your subscription ends on [DATE] (3 days).

To renew:
1. Click the payment link: [Polar.sh link]
2. Reply with transaction hash
3. We'll extend for another 30 days

Or if you're done with it, no worries! Would love quick feedback
on what worked / what didn't before you go.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**If they don't renew, send follow-up:**
```
Subject: Quick question about Interview Assistant

Hey [name],

Noticed you didn't renew. No problem at all!

Would you mind sharing why? (Too expensive, didn't use it enough,
found something better, etc.)

Trying to improve the product and your honest feedback helps.

Thanks for trying it out!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear renewal instructions (removes friction)
- Exit interview (learn why churn happens)
- Friendly tone (not guilt-tripping)

---

## Script 9: Testimonial Request

**When:** Customer has been using product for 1+ months and seems happy
**Goal:** Get testimonial for landing page

**Email:**
```
Subject: Quick favor?

Hey [name],

You've been using Interview Assistant for a few weeks now. Hope
it's been helpful!

Would you be willing to write a quick testimonial? Doesn't need to
be fancy—just a sentence or two about how you use it and whether
it's been worth it.

I'd love to feature it on the landing page (with your permission).

If you're up for it, just reply with:
- 1-2 sentences about your experience
- How you want to be credited (first name, Twitter handle, or anonymous)

Thanks!
```

**Follow-up if they agree:**
```
Awesome, thank you!

If you're comfortable, a few details help make it more credible:
- What's your use case? (cover letters, interview prep, etc.)
- What did you use before? (manual resume updates, Notion, etc.)
- What's the biggest benefit for you? (time savings, quality, etc.)

No pressure to answer all—whatever you're comfortable sharing!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Asks when they're already happy (timing matters)
- Makes it easy (just 1-2 sentences)
- Offers anonymity option (lowers barrier)

---

## Script 10: Referral Request

**When:** Customer seems very satisfied (3+ months of usage)
**Goal:** Get referrals to grow via word-of-mouth

**Email:**
```
Subject: Know anyone who'd benefit from this?

Hey [name],

You've been using Interview Assistant for a while now—really appreciate
your support!

Quick question: know anyone else who might benefit from this?
(People doing job searches, consultants, AI power users, etc.)

If you refer someone who signs up, I'll give you both 1 month free.
Just have them mention your name when they pay.

No pressure—just figured I'd ask since you seem to find it useful!

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Targets happy customers (won't annoy unhappy ones)
- Offers incentive (free month for both)
- Low effort (just mention your name)
- Optional (no pressure)

---

## Script 11: Re-engagement (Inactive User)

**When:** Customer signed up but hasn't used product in 2+ weeks
**Goal:** Understand blocker, help them get value, reduce churn

**Email:**
```
Subject: Having trouble with Interview Assistant?

Hi [name],

Noticed you haven't used Interview Assistant in a couple weeks.
Everything okay?

Common issues I've seen:
- MCP setup confusing (happy to help troubleshoot)
- Not sure what to ask in interviews (I can share examples)
- Just busy (totally get it!)

If something's not working, reply and I'll help fix it.

If you're just not finding it useful, that's okay too—let me know
and I'll refund this month. No hard feelings.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Shows you care (personalized outreach)
- Identifies common blockers (helps them succeed)
- Offers refund (builds trust)

## General Outreach Principles

### Do's
✅ **Personalize:** Reference their specific comment/question
✅ **Add value first:** Help before asking for anything
✅ **Be conversational:** Write like you're talking to a friend
✅ **Ask questions:** Learn from every conversation
✅ **Follow up:** If they don't respond, gentle nudge after 3-5 days
✅ **Thank them:** Always appreciate their time/feedback

### Don'ts
❌ **Don't copy-paste same message:** People can tell
❌ **Don't be pushy:** No guilt trips or pressure
❌ **Don't argue:** If they're not interested, move on
❌ **Don't ignore criticism:** Negative feedback is valuable
❌ **Don't spam:** One message per person per week max
❌ **Don't fake urgency:** "Only 2 spots left!" is transparent

---

## Response Time Guidelines

**Reddit comments:** Respond within 6 hours (shows you're engaged)
**Direct messages:** Respond within 24 hours (shows you care)
**Email inquiries:** Respond within 12 hours (builds trust)
**Support requests:** Respond within 4 hours if possible (early stage = great support)

**Why speed matters:**
- Shows you're actively building (not abandoned project)
- Builds trust (responsive founder)
- Increases conversion (strike while they're interested)

---

## Tracking Conversations

**Create a "Conversation Log" in your tracking spreadsheet:**

| Date | Contact | Channel | Topic | Your Response | Their Response | Next Step | Status |
|------|---------|---------|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 2/24 | john@mail.com | Email | Waitlist signup | Used Script 1 | Interested in CV feature | Follow up on 3/1 | Active |
| 2/25 | @alice_dev | Reddit DM | Tried demo | Used Script 5 | Confused about MCP setup | Send setup guide | Needs help |

**Why track:**
- Don't lose leads (follow up at right time)
- Learn patterns (which scripts convert best?)
- Improve responses (what objections come up repeatedly?)

---

## A/B Testing Your Scripts

**Try two versions, see which converts better:**

**Example: Waitlist confirmation email**
- Version A: Asks about use case first
- Version B: Offers discount code upfront

**Track:**
- Response rate (% who reply)
- Conversion rate (% who eventually pay)
- Time to conversion (days from first contact to payment)

**Iterate:**
- Double down on what works
- Adjust or drop what doesn't

---

## When to Stop Outreaching

**Red flags:**
- 20+ DMs sent, 0 responses (wrong audience or bad messaging)
- 5+ people say "not interested" with same reason (product issue)
- You're spending >3 hours/day on outreach (doesn't scale)

**Green lights:**
- 30%+ response rate (good messaging + audience fit)
- 10%+ conversion to waitlist (strong interest)
- People replying with questions (engaged audience)
