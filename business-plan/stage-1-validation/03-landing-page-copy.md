### The Problem (3 bullets)

**Section Header:** "Sound Familiar?"

- **You forget your best work** - "What did I accomplish at that job 3 years ago?" You did amazing things but can't articulate them under pressure.
- **ChatGPT gives you generic fluff** - You paste your info, ChatGPT writes "results-oriented professional with proven track record." Recruiters see through it instantly.
- **Updating takes hours** - Every application means reformatting, rewriting, and hoping the ATS doesn't reject you. You have better things to do.

---

### Why Not Just Use ChatGPT? (CRITICAL SECTION)

**Section Header:** "ChatGPT Writes Resumes. We Write YOUR Resume."

```
ChatGPT can polish text you give it. But most people can't
articulate their own accomplishments well.

Our AI interviews you like a career coach -- asking follow-ups,
drawing out quantifiable impact, catching things you'd forget.

That's the difference between:
  "Managed a development team"
and:
  "Led a 12-person engineering team that delivered a $2M
   platform migration 3 weeks ahead of schedule"

You already know this stuff. You just need someone to ask
the right questions.
```

### How It Works (3 Steps)

**Section Header:** "15 Minutes. That's It."

**Step 1: Quick Conversation**
Chat with our Telegram bot for 10-15 minutes. Just talk naturally about your experience, projects, skills. It asks smart follow-up questions -- like a career coach, not a form.

**Step 2: AI Extraction**

### FAQ Section

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT polishes text you already have. We interview you -- asking follow-up questions, drawing out specifics, catching accomplishments you'd forget. Think career coach, not text editor. The result is richer, more specific, and uniquely yours.

**Q: Is the resume ATS-friendly?**
A: Yes. Clean formatting, proper heading hierarchy, keyword-rich content. Designed to pass automated screening systems that reject 75% of resumes.

**Q: Do I need technical skills?**
A: No. If you can use Telegram, you can use this. Just chat naturally. The AI assistant features (Claude/ChatGPT memory) are a bonus for technical users.

**Q: How does the free tier work?**
A: One full interview session and one resume generation, completely free. No credit card required. If you like it, upgrade to keep generating and updating.

## Version B: MCP Technical Focus (Secondary - For Technical Communities)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Give ANY AI Assistant Structured Long-Term Memory
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Not another passive memory dump. Active interviews extract deep,
structured knowledge. Your AI actually understands your context.
```

**CTA Button:**
```
[Join Early Access →]
```

---

### The Problem (3 bullets)

**Section Header:** "AI Memory Shouldn't Be Passive"

- **Shallow capture** - Tools like Mem0 passively record fragments. You get "user prefers Python" not "led migration of 500K LOC Java codebase to Python, reducing deploy time 60%."
- **No structure** - Knowledge graphs capture entities and relationships but miss the narrative. Context without story is just noise.
- **You repeat yourself** - Every Claude conversation starts from zero. Copy-paste the same background. Every. Single. Time.

---

### How We're Different (vs Mem0, Zep, etc.)

**Section Header:** "Active Interviews > Passive Capture"

```
Other memory tools watch what you do and passively store fragments.

We interview you. Systematically. Like a journalist building
a profile -- asking follow-ups, going deeper, tracking what's
been covered and what hasn't.

The result: structured, comprehensive knowledge that AI can
actually USE, not just retrieve.

Mem0 stores: "user knows Python"
We store: "Led Python migration at Acme Corp (2023). Converted 500K LOC
Java monolith to Python microservices. Team of 8. Reduced deploy
time 60%. Chose FastAPI over Django for async workloads."

That's the difference between memory and understanding.
```

---

### How It Works

**Step 1: Structured Interviews**
Quick Telegram conversations that systematically cover your knowledge. The AI tracks coverage -- it knows what it's asked and what it hasn't. Progressive deepening, not random fragments.

**Step 2: Knowledge Extraction**
AI extracts structured summaries with semantic embeddings. Organized by life areas, searchable by meaning, not just keywords.

**Step 3: MCP Integration**
Standard MCP server that works with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible AI. Bearer token auth. 5-minute setup.

**Coming Soon: MCP Apps**
Interactive knowledge dashboard rendered directly inside Claude and ChatGPT via the new MCP Apps extension (SEP-1865).

### Technical FAQ

**Q: How is this different from Mem0/OpenMemory?**
A: Mem0 passively captures fragments from your AI conversations. We actively interview you -- systematically, with coverage tracking -- extracting deep structured knowledge. It's the difference between a security camera and a journalist interview.

**Q: How is this different from Zep?**
A: Zep builds knowledge graphs from documents and conversations. We do active structured interviews with follow-up questions and progressive deepening. Our knowledge is richer because it's intentionally extracted, not passively observed.

**Q: Which AIs are supported?**
A: Any MCP-compatible AI. Confirmed: Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot, JetBrains, Goose, Raycast. MCP is now an industry standard (Linux Foundation).

**Q: Is the MCP protocol stable?**
A: MCP is governed by the Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation) with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and AWS as members. Current spec version: 2025-11-25. We maintain backward compatibility.

**Q: Can I self-host?**
A: Yes. Self-Hosted tier includes Docker Compose setup and full deployment documentation.

## Implementation Notes

**Strategy: Lead with Version A**

**Email Capture:**
- ConvertKit (free for 1,000 subscribers) or Mailchimp free tier
- Tag signups by source (Reddit community, segment interest)

**Hosting:**
- Vercel (free for static sites)
- Carrd ($19/year for no-code)
- Netlify (free tier)

**Analytics:**
- Plausible (privacy-friendly, free self-hosted or $9/mo hosted)
- Track: page views, video plays, signup conversion rate, source/referrer

## Copy Principles Used

1. **Address the #1 objection** - "Why not ChatGPT?" answered prominently
2. **Concrete comparison** - Show before/after resume bullet points
3. **Free tier first** - Lower barrier, avoid "paywall" backlash
4. **ATS is table stakes** - Mentioned early and prominently
5. **Traditional payments default** - Credit cards first, crypto as option
6. **Competitor differentiation** - Version B explicitly positions vs Mem0/Zep
7. **SEO-aware** - Target keywords in headings and meta tags
