# SEO Strategy - Start in Stage 1

**Why now:** SEO is the #1 acquisition channel for resume tools (Teal, Rezi, Jobscan all grew this way). Pages take 2-3 months to index and rank. Starting now means organic traffic arrives by Stage 2-3.

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours/week (one blog post + landing page optimization)
