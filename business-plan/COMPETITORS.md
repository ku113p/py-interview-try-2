## Your Unique Position

**What you do that nobody else does:**
Active structured interviews that systematically extract deep career knowledge through conversation, with coverage tracking and progressive deepening.

**The career coach analogy:** A human career coach interviews you ($200-700), draws out your accomplishments, and writes your resume. You do the same thing for $12/month via AI. No competitor offers this.

## MCP Memory Competitors (Segment B)

### Mem0 / OpenMemory
- **What:** Local-first persistent memory server for AI assistants
- **How it works:** Passively captures coding preferences and patterns from your AI conversations
- **Pricing:** Free / open-source
- **Strengths:** Most mature MCP memory solution. Works across Cursor, VS Code, Claude. Shared memory across tools. Good community.
- **Weakness:** **Passive capture only.** Stores fragments like "user prefers Python." No active interviews, no structured extraction, no coverage tracking.
- **Your advantage:** Active interviews extract 10x deeper knowledge. "Led Python migration at Acme Corp, team of 8, 60% deploy time reduction" vs "user knows Python."

### Zep AI
- **What:** Temporal knowledge graph memory powered by Graphiti framework
- **How it works:** Builds knowledge graphs from documents and conversations
- **Pricing:** Paid (startup, Y Combinator backed, $2.3M raised)
- **Strengths:** Sophisticated knowledge graph. Temporal awareness. VC funding for fast development.
- **Weakness:** **Passive observation, not active extraction.** Captures entities and relationships but misses narrative context. Enterprise-focused.
- **Your advantage:** Structured interviews with follow-up questions extract richer, more usable knowledge. Indie/prosumer market (they're enterprise).

### Anthropic Knowledge Graph Memory
- **What:** Official reference implementation from Anthropic
- **Pricing:** Free / open-source
- **Strengths:** Official, well-documented
- **Weakness:** Reference/demo quality, not a product. No active extraction. No interview workflow.
- **Your advantage:** Full product with interview flow, CV generation, coverage tracking.

### Basic Memory, Cognee, Nowledge Mem
- **What:** Various lightweight memory MCP servers
- **Strengths:** Simple, local-first
- **Weakness:** Very basic. Key-value or simple graph. No structured extraction.
- **Your advantage:** Comprehensive interview workflow, knowledge extraction pipeline, CV generation.

### Positioning Statement (MCP Segment)

> "Unlike passive memory tools (Mem0, Zep) that capture fragments from your conversations, Interview Assistant actively interviews you -- systematically, with coverage tracking and follow-up questions. The result is structured, comprehensive knowledge your AI can actually use, not just retrieve."

## CV / Resume Builder Competitors (Segment A)

### ChatGPT / Claude (Direct Prompting)
- **What:** Users paste their info into ChatGPT and ask for a resume
- **Pricing:** Free (ChatGPT) or $20/month (Plus)
- **Strengths:** Free, flexible, no new tool to learn
- **Weakness:** **Users must articulate their own accomplishments** -- most people undersell themselves. Generic output ("results-oriented professional"). No formatting. No ATS optimization. No persistence.
- **Your advantage:** Active interview draws out specifics users would forget. Follow-up questions like "what was the impact?" and "how big was the team?" capture 10x richer content. Plus formatting + ATS + persistence.

**This is the #1 objection to address in all marketing.** Every Reddit post will get "just use ChatGPT."

**Counter-argument:** "ChatGPT polishes text you give it. But most people can't describe their own accomplishments well. Our AI interviews you like a career coach -- that's the difference between 'managed a team' and 'led 12-person team that delivered $2M project 3 weeks early.'"

### Teal
- **Pricing:** Free tier + $9/week or $29/month
- **What:** Resume builder + job tracker + AI writing
- **Strengths:** Full job search platform. Chrome extension for LinkedIn. Strong SEO (huge blog). Form-based builder is polished.
- **Weakness:** **Form-based.** You fill in fields, AI polishes. Not conversational. No active extraction. No MCP integration.
- **Your advantage:** Conversational extraction is more natural and captures things forms miss. MCP integration for AI memory. Career coach experience vs spreadsheet experience.

### Rezi
- **Pricing:** $29/month or $149 lifetime
- **What:** AI resume builder with templates
- **Strengths:** Good AI bullet point writer. $149 lifetime deal is very popular on Reddit.
- **Weakness:** Template + form based. You must know what to write. AI helps polish but doesn't extract.
- **Your advantage:** Same as vs Teal -- conversational extraction captures what forms miss.

### Kickresume
- **Pricing:** $5-19/month
- **What:** Resume builder with LinkedIn import
- **Strengths:** Cheap. LinkedIn import saves time. Good templates.
- **Weakness:** LinkedIn data is already formatted/polished (missing raw accomplishments). Form-based editing.
- **Your advantage:** Interview extracts deeper content than what's on LinkedIn. Follow-up questions reveal hidden accomplishments.

### Jobscan
- **Pricing:** $49.95/month
- **What:** ATS resume scanner/optimizer
- **Strengths:** Market leader for ATS scoring. Shows exact keyword matches against job descriptions.
- **Weakness:** Only checks/scores, doesn't generate. Expensive.
- **Your advantage:** Generate AND optimize in one step. Much cheaper.

### Human Career Coaches
- **Pricing:** $200-700 (mid-career), $1,000-3,500 (executive)
- **What:** Phone interview + professional resume writing
- **Strengths:** Truly personalized. Human judgment. High quality.
- **Weakness:** Expensive. Slow (1-2 weeks turnaround). Not scalable.
- **Your advantage:** Same interview approach, 10-50x cheaper, instant results, available 24/7, unlimited updates.

### Positioning Statement (CV Segment)

> "Interview Assistant is the $12/month AI career coach. Like a professional resume writer, it interviews you -- asking follow-up questions, drawing out specifics, catching accomplishments you'd forget. Unlike ChatGPT, it doesn't just polish what you give it. Unlike Teal or Rezi, it doesn't make you fill out forms. You just talk naturally for 15 minutes and get an ATS-optimized resume."

## Threats to Monitor

1. **Mem0 adds active interviews** - They have the users and funding. If they add interview features, they're a serious threat. Mitigate by building deeper interview workflow and CV generation.

2. **Teal adds conversational mode** - They have SEO traffic and users. Conversational is a feature they could add. Mitigate by being the best at interviews + MCP integration.

3. **LinkedIn builds AI resume coach** - They have the data. But their incentive is to keep users ON LinkedIn, not help them export. Low probability but high impact.

4. **ChatGPT adds memory + formatting** - ChatGPT already has memory (basic). If they add resume formatting and active coaching prompts, it's a threat. Mitigate by being specialized + privacy-first + MCP.

## Opportunities

1. **MCP Apps (SEP-1865)** - Render interactive interview UI inside Claude/ChatGPT. No competitor does this yet.
2. **Voice interviews** - Telegram supports voice messages. Interview via voice for more natural extraction.
3. **ATS scoring against job descriptions** - Generate tailored resumes per job posting. High-value feature competitors charge $50/mo for.
4. **Referral from career coaches** - Partner with coaches who can't scale. They refer clients, you provide the tool.
5. **White-label for recruiting agencies** - Agencies could use your tool to process candidate information.
