## Individual Responses

### 1. Maya Chen, 41 — Pre-Seed Angel

**Background:** Ex-CTO of a YC startup (HR-tech), exited for $40M. Invests $25-100K in developer tools, AI-native products.

**Decision: Conditional Yes — $50K SAFE at $2-3M cap**

**What excites her:** The interview-to-structured-data pipeline is infrastructure, not just an app. MCP angle is genuine technical vision. CV wedge is smart GTM — solving a problem today, not just pitching a protocol.

**Condition:** Launch, get 50 real users through free tier, demonstrate 10% conversion to paid. "That is a 60-90 day ask, not a 'come back in a year' ask."

**Biggest concern:** Platform risk — if Claude ships native deep-memory interviewing, you're competing with the platform. Also: CV output quality must be demonstrably better than alternatives.

**90-day advice:** Launch free tier publicly. Get 200 signups. Hire a professional resume writer to evaluate CV prompts. Incorporate as Delaware C-corp. Start MCP tier waitlist.

**Comps:** Jasper AI (early days), Crystal Knows, Notion, Eightfold AI. Likely outcome: acquisition by AI platform for $30-80M in 3-4 years.

---

### 2. David Park, 55 — Traditional VC Partner

**Background:** Partner at a mid-tier VC fund ($200M AUM). Metrics-driven, $500K minimum checks. Needs path to $100M ARR.

**Decision: Not Yet**

**What would bring him back:** $10K MRR (any mix). Retention data proving people return for second interviews. Clean legal entity + books. Would then lead a $1.5-2M seed at $8-12M valuation.

**Biggest concern:** Market framing is muddled — "Are you a resume builder? A personal knowledge management tool? An AI memory layer? An enterprise knowledge capture platform?" Four pricing tiers, four segments, two products. Too many things for one person.

**90-day advice:** Pick one segment (job seekers). Kill self-hosted tier. Get to $5K MRR on CV Pro alone. Use traction to raise a proper seed. Then hire and build MCP/knowledge.

**Comps:** Grammarly (narrow → platform), Guru ($200M+ acquisition), Notion/Mem (system of record).

---

### 3. Amira Osei, 33 — AI-Focused Micro-VC

**Background:** GP at a $30M fund focused on AI-native products. Thesis: structured context layers are the next value wave.

**Decision: Yes — $300K pre-seed SAFE at $3M cap**

**What excites her:** Thesis-perfectly-aligned. Building the "personal AI data layer" — infrastructure for the post-wrapper era. Structured interviews produce genuinely richer data than Mem0/Zep's key-value pairs. 43% willingness to pay pre-product is a strong signal.

**No conditions.** "I do not need to see revenue to invest in a thesis-aligned founder who has already built the product."

**Biggest concern:** MCP adoption velocity. 52% confusion on MCP even among tech-savvy respondents. If MCP stalls, you become "just" a CV tool.

**90-day advice:** Ship free tier, get 100 completed interviews, analyze obsessively. Build dead-simple MCP demo video. Get into Anthropic's MCP partner directory.

**Comps:** Rewind AI/Limitless ($350M raised), Clay (data enrichment), Eightfold AI ($2.1B valuation).

---

### 4. Robert Walsh, 62 — Conservative Angel

**Background:** Retired insurance exec, $10-50K checks. "Boring businesses that make money."

**Decision: No**

**What would change his mind:** Simple story: "I sell AI-powered resume building for $79, I have 500 paying customers, my CAC is $15, and I am growing 20% month over month." Strip away everything else. "That is a business I understand."

**Biggest concern:** "The founder is in love with the technology and not in love with the customer." Pitch talks more about MCP than about the person who lost their job and needs a resume by Friday.

**90-day advice:** Stop building for 30 days. Manually help 20 real job seekers create resumes via Zoom. Charge $50 each. Watch them use the product. Then rebuild onboarding around what you learned.

**Comps:** Zety, Resume.io ($30-40M revenue). "Not a unicorn, but it puts food on the table."

---

### 5. Priya Sharma, 38 — Strategic (VP Ecosystem, Anthropic)

**Background:** Manages MCP partnerships and developer relations at Anthropic.

**Decision: Conditional Yes — for partnership, not investment**

**What she offers:** Featured placement in MCP partner directory. Early access to MCP roadmap. Anthropic Builders program ($25K API credits + mentorship). Co-marketing at conferences. "You are building exactly the product we want to exist in our ecosystem but do not want to build ourselves."

**Condition:** Product quality — needs to use it herself and verify the MCP integration works cleanly with Claude. "Send me a working demo and I will evaluate within two weeks."

**Key insight:** "MCP adoption is growing 40% month-over-month. Claude's built-in memory is intentionally lightweight because we believe richer context should live in user-controlled MCP servers."

**90-day advice:** Make MCP integration exemplary (reference implementation). Create end-to-end demo video (interview → Claude uses knowledge). Apply to Anthropic Builders (April cohort).

**Comps:** Zapier (ecosystem connective tissue), LangChain ($3B valuation as ecosystem-critical). Likely outcome: $50-150M acquisition by AI platform.

---

### 6. Marcus Thompson, 45 — Bootstrapper Angel

**Background:** Built and sold a $5M ARR SaaS. Invests $10-25K in capital-efficient bootstrapped startups.

**Decision: Conditional Yes — $15-20K SAFE at $1.5M cap**

**What excites him:** Unit economics potential. $79 lifetime → upsell to $29/mo recurring. Zero GTM budget = discipline, not weakness. "Not every company needs to be a unicorn."

**Condition:** $1K MRR from organic customers. Cohort data showing lifetime buyers come back and upgrade.

**Biggest concern:** Building two products simultaneously as a solo founder. "The CV generator and the MCP knowledge platform serve different buyers with different motivations."

**90-day advice:** Incorporate tomorrow. Launch CV as standalone — don't mention MCP on landing page. Get 50 paying CV customers. Ask if they'd pay $29/mo for knowledge features. Kill or limit free tier to filter for real demand.

**Comps:** Resume.io (bootstrapped millions ARR), Jasper.ai (early), Carrd (solo founder, simple product, real business).

---

### 7. Jennifer Liu, 50 — HR-Tech / Future of Work VC

**Background:** Partner at HR-tech fund ($150M AUM). Invests Seed to Series A.

**Decision: Not Yet**

**What would bring her back:** 2-3 enterprise pilot companies (even free). Co-founder with HR-tech/enterprise sales experience. Team/enterprise pricing + SSO + compliance roadmap. "These are fixable, but they're 6-12 months of work."

**Key insight:** "Multi-entity knowledge — that's the enterprise signal. A tool that captures knowledge about projects, clients, and processes (not just individuals) is what enterprises will pay for." Offered to introduce to 3 CHROs in her network.

**Biggest concern:** Platform risk + staying stuck as consumer CV tool. "The real opportunity here is not CVs — it's becoming the structured interview layer that sits between humans and AI knowledge systems in the enterprise."

**90-day advice:** Launch CV, collect data on interview usage patterns. In parallel, have conversations with HR leaders about knowledge loss during offboarding. "That qualitative data is worth more than any simulated focus group."

**Comps:** Guru (~$100M acquisition), Lessonly (~$100M acquisition), Eightfold AI (unicorn).

---

### 8. Nikolai Petrov, 37 — Eastern European Tech Investor

**Background:** GP at a $50M fund. Backs technical solo founders, capital-efficient, global ambition.

**Decision: Yes — $50K SAFE at $2M cap + pro-rata rights**

**What excites him:** Technical moat in structured knowledge extraction. Infrastructure layer via MCP = defensibility. Improving margins (LLM costs dropping 10x/18mo). Crypto payment = global-first distribution. "I've backed founders at this stage before and had great outcomes."

**No conditions.** Investing pre-revenue on founder + technical vision.

**Biggest concern:** Solo founder burnout. Selling + supporting + marketing + building simultaneously. Secondary: MCP timing risk, but mitigated because CV works standalone.

**90-day advice:** Incorporate (Stripe Atlas). Launch on Product Hunt + Reddit. Target: 200 free users, 20 paying in 90 days. Track interview completion rate obsessively. Record 2-min demo video. Start looking for growth-focused co-founder.

**Comps:** Grammarly (Ukrainian founders, consumer → enterprise), Loom ($975M acquisition), Crystal Knows ($16M raised).

---

### 9. Sarah Kim, 43 — Consumer/Prosumer VC

**Background:** Partner at consumer fund. Early investor in Notion, Canva, Figma. Product-obsessed.

**Decision: Conditional Yes — $300-500K seed at $3-4M cap**

**What excites her:** Product-led growth potential ("My AI knows me" is a flex that sells itself). Prosumer-to-enterprise bridge is clear. MCP knowledge layer creates a new category. "Every time I start a new Claude conversation and have to re-explain my context, I think 'why doesn't this thing just know me?'"

**Condition:** Needs to use the product herself. Three tests: (1) Is the interview engaging or tedious? (2) Is CV output genuinely better than ChatGPT + good prompt? (3) Does MCP integration work seamlessly?

**Biggest concern:** Product experience must be magical. "If the interview feels like filling out a form, people will bail." Time commitment (1-2 hrs) is a red flag.

**90-day advice:** Get 20 humans through full pipeline, measure completion rate + NPS. Build "5-minute quick start" that produces LinkedIn summary. Private beta with 100 users. Ask beta users to share screenshots of AI "knowing" them — that's the marketing.

**Comps:** Notion trajectory (prosumer → teams → enterprise), Canva, Jasper.ai. "The best comp might be Evernote in 2008. Let's hope the execution is better."

---

### 10. James Wright, 58 — Skeptical Generalist Angel

**Background:** Retired VP Engineering at Microsoft. Invests in 2-3 deals/year. Hard to impress.

**Decision: No**

**Reasoning:** "You have no entity, no revenue, no users, and no co-founder. AI personas telling you they'd pay for an AI product is circular validation." Platform dependency on Anthropic's MCP. Two products in one pitch. Pattern: smart founder builds impressive tech, can't decide what the product is, runs out of energy.

**What would change his mind:** (a) Legal entity, (b) 100+ real users who completed interviews, (c) 10+ paying customers not personally recruited, (d) clear answer: "Are you a CV company or a knowledge management company?" Also needs to understand the moat: "Any developer with API access could build a structured interview tool in a weekend."

**Biggest concern:** "Technical excellence doesn't sell products — distribution does. Who's going to do your marketing, sales, partnerships, and support while you're writing code?"

**90-day advice:** Stop building features. Incorporate this week. Launch next week — not beta, not early access, launch. Sell CVs to strangers. Get to $1K MRR with zero paid marketing. Find a co-founder (not employee) who handles GTM.

**Comps:** "Dozens of AI wrapper companies from 2023-2024 — most are dead." Optimistic: LinkedIn's early "own the professional identity layer." If knowledge platform works: "Palantir for individuals."

## Cross-Investor Analysis

### Decision Distribution
- **Yes (unconditional):** 2/10 — Amira (AI thesis fund) and Nikolai (Eastern European tech)
- **Conditional Yes:** 4/10 — Maya (50 users), Marcus ($1K MRR), Sarah (product trial), Priya (partnership)
- **Not Yet:** 2/10 — David ($10K MRR), Jennifer (enterprise pilots)
- **No:** 2/10 — Robert (wants revenue + simplicity), James (wants everything: entity, users, revenue, focus)

### Universal Concerns (raised by 7+ of 10)
1. **Incorporate immediately** — every single investor mentioned this
2. **Pick one product** — CV tool or knowledge platform, not both in the pitch
3. **Solo founder risk** — 8/10 flagged burnout or need for co-founder
4. **Show real users, not simulated data** — multiple investors explicitly dismissed AI focus groups

### Consensus 90-Day Priorities
1. **Incorporate** (10/10 — literally unanimous)
2. **Launch CV product** (9/10 — as standalone, without MCP in the pitch)
3. **Get real paying users** (8/10 — thresholds vary: 10 to 500)
4. **Record a demo video** (6/10 — showing interview → CV pipeline)
5. **Find a co-founder or growth person** (6/10)
6. **Apply to Anthropic Builders** (specific from Priya, reinforced by Amira)

### Valuation Consensus

| With $5-10K MRR | $8-12M | David |
| Seed with product traction | $3-4M cap | Sarah, Amira |
| Enterprise pivot (later) | Much higher | Jennifer |

### Market Size Estimates
| Framing | TAM Estimate | Source |

## Key Findings

### 1. The business is fundable NOW — for the right investors
Two investors said yes unconditionally. Four more would invest with conditions achievable in 60-90 days. The "not yet" investors have clear, actionable thresholds. Only 2 outright passed, and even they said "come back with revenue."

### 2. Incorporation is non-negotiable
Every single investor — from the bootstrapper to the VC — flagged the lack of entity. This is the single most unanimous piece of feedback.

### 3. "Two products in one pitch" is the #1 strategic concern
Even investors who said yes warned about this. The CV tool and MCP knowledge platform need to be pitched separately, or the CV framed clearly as the entry point for a larger vision — not as co-equal products.

### 4. Real users trump everything
Multiple investors explicitly dismissed simulated focus group data. The transition from AI-simulated validation to real-user validation is the critical next step. James: "AI personas telling you they'd pay for an AI product is circular validation."

### 5. Co-founder/growth person is the #2 people concern
6/10 investors specifically mentioned finding someone for distribution/GTM. The pattern "technical founder who can't get distribution" is well-known and feared.

### 6. The Anthropic partnership opportunity is uniquely valuable
Priya's offer (MCP partner directory, $25K credits, co-marketing, Builders program) may be worth more than early angel investment. Multiple other investors independently suggested getting into Anthropic's ecosystem.

### 7. Enterprise is a later play, but investors see it
Jennifer and David both see a massive enterprise opportunity (knowledge capture, offboarding). But both agree: don't build enterprise features now. Validate consumer, then pivot up.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Incorporate** — Stripe Atlas, Delaware C-corp, takes a week
2. **Simplify the pitch** — lead with CV, mention knowledge/MCP as vision only
3. **Apply to Anthropic Builders** — April cohort, highest-leverage partnership

### Next 90 Days
1. **Launch CV product** as a standalone offering
2. **Get 50-200 real users** through the interview-to-CV pipeline
3. **Record a 2-minute demo video** showing the full flow
4. **Track obsessively:** interview completion rate, CV quality (NPS), free → paid conversion
5. **Build "5-minute quick start"** for immediate value (LinkedIn summary or elevator pitch)
6. **Start looking for a growth co-founder or first hire**

### Fundraising Sequencing
1. **Now:** Accept Amira ($300K) and Nikolai ($50K) — $350K pre-seed at $2-3M cap
2. **At 50 users + 10% conversion:** Trigger Maya ($50K) and Marcus ($15-20K)
3. **At product trial:** Trigger Sarah ($300-500K) — she needs to use it first
4. **At $10K MRR:** Approach David for $1.5-2M seed at $8-12M
5. **With enterprise pilots:** Approach Jennifer for larger round

### What NOT to Do
- Don't build enterprise features, SSO, or compliance yet
- Don't pitch MCP to non-technical audiences — lead with outcomes (CV, "AI that knows you")
- Don't keep four pricing tiers — simplify to Free + CV Pro + Knowledge Pro
- Don't spend on ads before organic is working
