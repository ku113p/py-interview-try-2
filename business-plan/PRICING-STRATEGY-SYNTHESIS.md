**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25
**Source:** Parallel brainstorming sessions (5 groups: Bootstrapper, SaaS Expert, Usage-Based Specialist, Freemium Growth, B2B/Enterprise)

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing input from 5 specialized pricing strategy groups and validating against real token costs ($0.19 per CV session), here are the **consensus recommendations** for Interview Assistant:

### Immediate Action (Stage 1 - Weeks 1-3)

**Simplified Launch Pricing:**
```
🆓 Free Trial: 1 CV (no credit card)
💰 Launch Special: $12 one-time (first 50 customers)
🎯 Regular Price: $19/mo or $149/year after launch
```

**Why this works:**
- Validates demand at low commitment ($12)
- Creates urgency (first 50 customers special)
- Simple enough for solo founder to manage
- Protects against high-volume user risk

### Stage 2-3 Expansion (Months 2-6)

**Add These Missing Tiers:**
1. **Knowledge Pro Lifetime: $199** (currently missing - focus groups flagged this)
2. **Starter Pack: $19 one-time** (3 CVs - lower barrier than $79 lifetime)
3. **Team Plan: $199/mo** (5 users, 50 CVs/month - B2B entry point)
4. **Academic Tier: $15/mo** (50% off with .edu email)

### Long-Term (Year 2+)

**B2B Expansion Pricing:**
- Small Team: $199-399/mo (2-10 users)
- Enterprise: $1,500+/mo (20+ users, custom contracts)
- Usage-based option: Credit packs for high-volume users

---

## Group 1: Bootstrapper Perspective

**Philosophy:** Speed to revenue > perfect pricing. Get to first paying customer in 48 hours.

### Core Recommendations

**Stage 1 Pricing (Launch):**
```
$9 early bird (first 25 customers) → $12 regular → $29 after validation
```

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ **No free tier until Stage 2** - Free users cost $0.19 each + support burden
- ✅ **One-time payments > subscriptions** early - No churn management overhead
- ✅ **Launch special creates urgency** - "17/25 spots filled" drives FOMO
- ✅ **Simple = fast** - One SKU, one price, one promise

**Landing Page Copy (Ready to Use):**
```
🔥 Launch Special: $9 (17/25 spots remaining)
Regular price $29, increases in 48 hours

✓ Complete career interview (60 minutes)
✓ Professional CV generated
✓ PDF + editable formats
✓ Lifetime access to updates
✓ MCP protocol for AI memory

[Get Started - $9]
```

**What to Change After 50 Customers:**
- Raise price to $19-29
- Add subscriptions ($12/mo)
- Introduce free tier (once support systems in place)

**Strengths:**
- 🚀 Fastest path to first revenue (48 hours vs 2-3 weeks)
- 💰 No monthly churn to manage
- 🎯 Clear validation signal (people pay or don't)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ No recurring revenue (harder to predict cashflow)
- ⚠️ Aggressive pricing might train users to expect "cheap"
- ⚠️ No free tier limits top-of-funnel growth

---

## Group 2: SaaS Value-Based Pricing Expert

**Philosophy:** Price on value delivered ($200-700 career coach replacement), not cost ($0.19 tokens). Current pricing is good but missing critical tiers.

### Core Recommendations

**Critical Gaps to Fill:**

1. **Knowledge Pro Lifetime: $199**
   - Currently only monthly ($29/mo) exists
   - Focus groups: "No lifetime option is a red flag" (Alex, developer)
   - Payback: 6.9 months, saves $150 over 3 years
   - Expected: 40-60% of Knowledge Pro users choose lifetime

2. **Self-Hosted Pricing Fix:**
   - Current: $59/mo (more than cloud $29/mo) → User reaction: "Why pay MORE to host myself?"
   - Fix: $249 one-time license + optional $99/yr support
   - Reasoning: Users provide compute → should pay less over time

3. **Academic Tier: $15/mo**
   - 50% discount with .edu email verification
   - Unlocks student/researcher segment (currently priced out)
   - Long-term play: Academic users become paying professionals later

4. **Team Tier: $22/seat/mo**
   - Minimum 5 seats = $110/mo entry point
   - Enables B2B motion without enterprise sales complexity

### Updated Pricing Structure

| Tier | Current | Recommended | Reasoning |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Free | ✅ 1 CV | ✅ Keep | Lead generation |
| CV Pro | ✅ $12/mo or $79 lifetime | ✅ Keep | Already optimal |
| Knowledge Pro Monthly | ✅ $29/mo | ✅ Keep | Developer sweet spot |
| **Knowledge Pro Lifetime** | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Add $199** | 40-60% will choose this |
| Self-Hosted | ⚠️ $59/mo | ✅ **Change to $249 one-time** | Psychology fix |
| Academic | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Add $15/mo** | Student segment |
| Team | ❌ Missing | ✅ **Add $199/mo (5 seats)** | B2B entry |

### Van Westendorp Analysis (from focus groups)

**Price Sensitivity Results:**
- $10-15 = "good value" (CV Pro at $12/mo ✅)
- $25-35 = "expensive but fair" (Knowledge Pro at $29/mo ✅)
- $75-100 = "getting expensive" (CV Pro lifetime at $79 ✅)
- $150-250 = "premium but justifiable for lifetime" (Knowledge Pro lifetime at $199 ✅)

**Value Anchors:**
- Human career coach: $200-700 per session → Your $79 lifetime is 96-99% cheaper
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo unlimited → Your $29/mo Knowledge Pro is comparable but deeper
- Mem0 (competitor): Free self-hosted → Your $29/mo is premium but turnkey

### Margin Analysis with New Tiers

| Tier | Price | Token Cost (avg) | Gross Margin | Margin % |
|------|-------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Knowledge Pro Lifetime | $199 | $0.19 × 20 CVs = $3.80 | $195.20 | **98.1%** |
| Self-Hosted (one-time) | $249 | $0 (user pays) | $249 | **100%** |
| Academic | $15/mo | $0.57 | $14.43 | **96.2%** |
| Team (per seat) | $22/mo | $3.80 (10 CVs/seat/mo) | $18.20 | **82.7%** |

**Verdict:** All new tiers maintain 80%+ margins. Safe to add.

**Strengths:**
- 📊 Data-driven (uses focus group findings)
- 💡 Fills actual gaps (not theoretical)
- 🎯 Segment-specific (Academic, Team, Power Users)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Adds complexity (more SKUs to manage)
- ⚠️ Requires more engineering (team features, .edu verification)
- ⚠️ Might overwhelm Stage 1 validation

## Group 3: Usage-Based Pricing Specialist

**Philosophy:** Fairest pricing aligns payment with consumption. Charge per CV generated, not flat monthly fee.

### Core Recommendations

**Credit Pack Pricing:**

| Pack | Credits | Price | Per-Credit | Discount | Target Customer |
|------|---------|-------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Trial | 1 | $0 | $0 | - | Everyone |
| Starter | 3 | $27 | $9.00 | 10% | Testing |
| Individual | 10 | $79 | $7.90 | 21% | Job seekers |
| Professional | 25 | $175 | $7.00 | 30% | Coaches |
| Business | 100 | $599 | $5.99 | 40% | Small recruiting firms |
| Enterprise | 500 | $2,499 | $5.00 | 50% | Large recruiting firms |

**Credit Expiration Policy:**
- 12-month rolling rollover from purchase date
- Credits consumed oldest-first (FIFO)
- Warning emails 30 days before expiration

**MCP Memory: Separate $19/mo Add-On**
- MCP queries don't consume CV credits
- Prevents gaming (user does 1 interview, never buys more credits)
- Aligns with recurring value (daily AI use vs transactional CV generation)

### Why Usage-Based is Fairer

**Subscription Model (current $29/mo unlimited):**
- Low-volume user (2 CVs/year): Pays $348/year for $0.38 in compute (83% waste)
- High-volume recruiter (200 CVs/month): Pays $348/year for $456 in compute (you lose $108)
- **Problem:** Cross-subsidization is unfair and unsustainable

**Credit Model:**
- Low-volume user: Buys 10-credit pack for $79, uses 2 = $15.80 effective cost (fair)
- High-volume recruiter: Buys 500-credit packs regularly = $2,499 per 500 CVs = $5/CV (fair)
- **Solution:** Everyone pays proportionally to consumption

### Customer Segment Examples

**Job Seeker (Sarah - 6 CVs needed):**
- Option: Individual Pack ($79 for 10 credits) = $7.90/CV
- Your cost: $1.14 (6 × $0.19)
- Margin: $77.86 (98.6%)

**Career Coach (Marcus - 300 CVs/year):**
- Option: 3× Business Packs ($599 × 3 = $1,797/year)
- Your cost: $57 (300 × $0.19)
- Margin: $1,740 (96.8%)
- **vs subscription:** Under $29/mo = $348/year, margin only $291 (83%)
- **Insight:** Usage-based captures 6× more revenue from power users

**Recruiting Firm (TechRecruit - 2,400 CVs/year):**
- Option: 5× Enterprise Packs ($2,499 × 5 = $12,495/year)
- Your cost: $456 (2,400 × $0.19)
- Margin: $12,039 (96.3%)
- **vs subscription:** Under $29/mo = $348/year, you LOSE $108/year
- **Critical:** Subscriptions make your best customers unprofitable

### Implementation Requirements

**Technical:**
- User table: `credit_balance INT, credit_expires_at TIMESTAMP[]`
- Purchase flow: Polar.sh webhooks → auto-add credits
- Consumption flow: Check balance > 0 before CV generation
- Expiration: Daily cron job for 30-day warnings

**UI/UX:**
- Dashboard: "You have 47 credits (23 expire Jan 1, 2027)"
- Before generation: "This will use 1 credit (46 remaining)"
- Buy more: "You used 8 credits this month. Business pack (100 credits) is best value."

**Strengths:**
- ⚖️ Fairest model (pay for what you use)
- 📈 Scales naturally (high-volume users pay proportionally)
- 💰 Captures enterprise revenue (recruiters pay $5K-12K/year vs $348)

**Weaknesses:**
- 🔧 Complex to implement (credit tracking, expiration logic)
- 🤔 Cognitive load (users must estimate usage upfront)
- 📊 Harder to predict revenue (vs monthly subscriptions)

## Group 4: Freemium Growth Hacker

**Philosophy:** Free tier drives growth, paid tier drives revenue. Optimize for 8-12% conversion (vs industry 2-5%) by delivering complete experience once, then charging for repeated use.

### Core Recommendations

**Updated Free Tier: "Full Experience Once"**
```
Free Tier Includes:
✓ Unlimited chat with interview bot
✓ Complete 1 full interview topic (career, projects, skills - their choice)
✓ Generate 1 professional CV (ATS-optimized PDF + HTML)
✓ 7-day MCP server trial (full AI memory access)
✓ See knowledge graph (read-only after trial)

Paywall After First Lifecycle:
✗ Can't interview on new topics (want to add "side projects"? Upgrade)
✗ Can't regenerate/update CV (made edits? Need new version? Upgrade)
✗ No more MCP access after 7 days (AI forgets you - pain returns)
✗ Can't export knowledge data (locked in, but transparent)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Users experience full value (not crippled demo)
- ✅ Aha moment delivered: "AI that knows me" or "I saved 6 hours"
- ✅ Conversion trigger is natural: need to update CV or MCP expires
- ✅ One complete experience costs $0.19 (acceptable CAC for 8-12% conversion)

**Add Starter Tier: $19 One-Time**
- Current gap: Jump from "1 CV free" to "$79 lifetime" is big
- Psychology: $19 feels transactional ("buying 3 CVs"), not commitment
- Use case: Job seeker who needs a few variations, not lifetime access
- Converts users who won't commit to $79 but need more than 1

**Adjust CV Pro Lifetime:**
- Current: $79 lifetime unlimited
- Change: $99/year (not lifetime) OR keep lifetime as limited early bird offer
- Reasoning: Lifetime cannibalizes recurring revenue; annual keeps engagement

**Complete Tier Structure:**

| Tier | Price | Features | Target Conversion |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 topic, 1 CV, 7-day MCP | N/A (top of funnel) |
| **Starter** | $19 one-time | 3 topics, 3 CVs, 30-day MCP | 3-5% (low-commitment) |
| **Pro** | $12/mo or $99/year | Unlimited | 5-7% (core conversion) |
| **Power** | $29/mo | Pro + API + integrations | 0.5-1% (power users) |

**Overall free → paid:** 8-12% (sum of Starter + Pro + Power)

### Conversion Funnel Design

```
Landing Page (15-25% conversion)
   ↓
Signup (email + password, no credit card)
   ↓
Onboarding (60% activation: signup → first CV)
   ↓
Aha Moment (~15 min: interview complete → CV generated)
   ↓
Value Reinforcement (Day 1-7 emails)
   ↓
Conversion Trigger:
  - MCP trial expires (pain returns)
  - Try to update CV (can't, need Pro)
  - Try to add new topic (paywall)
   ↓
Upgrade Prompt:
  - Starter ($19): "Just 3 more CVs"
  - Pro ($12/mo): "Unlimited everything"
   ↓
Payment (Polar.sh: credit card, Apple Pay, crypto)
```

**Expected Conversion Rates:**

| Stage | Target | Industry Benchmark |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Landing → Signup | 20% | 15-25% |
| Signup → First CV | 60% | 50-70% |
| First CV → Aha Moment | 80% | 70-90% |
| Aha → Consideration (needs it again) | 40% | 30-50% |
| Consideration → Payment | 20% | 15-30% |
| **Overall: Free → Paid (30 days)** | **8-12%** | **2-5%** |

**Why 8-12% vs industry 2-5%?**
1. High-pain problems (job search, AI productivity) = higher intent
2. Tangible ROI (save 6 hours + $200-700 vs career coach)
3. Low price point ($12/mo or $19 one-time) = impulse purchase
4. Free tier is complete experience, not crippled = trust building

### Viral Mechanics

**Referral Program:**

| Action | Referrer Reward | Referee Reward |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Refer friend (signs up) | +1 CV credit | Normal free tier |
| Friend upgrades to Starter | +3 CV credits | 10% off ($17.10) |
| Friend upgrades to Pro | +1 month free Pro | 1 month free |
| Refer 5 friends (who sign up) | Free Pro for 1 year | - |

**Timing:** After aha moment (CV generated or MCP setup complete), not before

**Social Sharing Triggers:**
```
After CV Generation:
"Your CV is ready! 🎉
Share with friends → unlock +1 CV credit:
[Tweet] [LinkedIn Post] [Copy Link]"

After MCP Setup:
"Claude now has your memory! 🧠
Show the AI community → unlock +3 topics:
[Tweet] [r/ClaudeAI Post] [Copy Link]"
```

### Retention Strategy

**CV Segment (transient users):**
- Quarterly emails: "Got promoted? Update your CV"
- Expand use cases: LinkedIn optimization, cover letters, interview prep
- Position as "career management tool" not "resume builder"

**MCP Segment (daily users):**
- Daily prompts: "Ask Claude about [topic from your knowledge]"
- Usage stats: "AI queried your knowledge 47 times this month"
- Knowledge expansion: "You've covered career - what about side projects?"

**Churn Prevention:**

| Signal | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| No login 7 days | Email: "Your knowledge base is waiting" |
| MCP trial expires, didn't upgrade | Offer: 50% off first month ($6) |
| Generated CV, no further activity | Email: "5 ways to use your knowledge" |

**Strengths:**
- 🚀 Optimized for growth (generous free tier + viral loops)
- 💰 Higher conversion than industry (8-12% vs 2-5%)
- 🔄 Retention strategy built-in (expand use cases)

**Weaknesses:**
- 💸 Free tier costs $0.19/user (need high conversion to offset)
- 🔧 Complex funnel (many touchpoints to optimize)
- 📈 Requires scale (100s of users to validate conversion rate)

### Revenue Projection by Segment (5-Year)

| Segment | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| B2C | $22K | $53K | $105K | $175K | $250K |
| Small Team | $0 | $48K | $119K | $239K | $478K |

| **TOTAL** | **$22K** | **$149K** | **$958K** | **$3,051K** | **$6,402K** |

**By Year 5:**
- B2C: 4% of revenue (lead generation engine)
- Teams: 16% of revenue (self-serve growth)
- Enterprise: 80% of revenue (sales-driven)

### Land & Expand Strategy

**Phase 1:** Land with individuals (B2C validation)
- Price: $12-29/mo
- Goal: 500-1,000 users, testimonials, product refinement

**Phase 2:** Expand to teams (detect 2-3 users from same company)
- Trigger: Email when multiple colleagues sign up
- Offer: Team plan 2-week free trial
- Price: $199-399/mo

**Phase 3:** Expand to enterprise (team customer outgrows 10 seats)
- Trigger: Account manager reaches out at 12+ seats
- Offer: Custom pricing with SSO, API, white-label
- Price: $1,500-5K/mo (annual contract)

**Phase 4:** Expand within enterprise (other departments adopt)
- Trigger: HR hears recruiting success, wants for career development
- Motion: Upsell additional seats + volume + add-ons
- Expansion: 20-50% YoY growth per customer

### Implementation Roadmap

**Stage 1-2 (Current):** B2C validation only - don't build B2B features yet
**Stage 3 (Months 4-6):** Add Team Plans (multi-user auth, dashboard, usage limits)
**Stage 4 (Months 7-12):** Add Enterprise (SSO, API, white-label) + hire first sales rep
**Stage 5 (Year 2+):** Scale enterprise sales (2-3 reps, 20-50 deals)

**Strengths:**
- 💰 Massive revenue potential ($6.4M by Year 5)
- 🎯 Clear path: B2C → Teams → Enterprise
- 📈 Land-and-expand motion validated by Slack, HubSpot, Figma

**Weaknesses:**
- ⏳ Slow to revenue (enterprise deals take 6-12 months)
- 👥 Requires hiring (sales team by Year 2)
- 🔧 Engineering-heavy (SSO, API, integrations)

---

## Consensus Recommendations: What All Groups Agree On

### 1. Current B2C Pricing is Validated ✅

**Keep these:**
- Free: 1 CV trial
- CV Pro: $12/mo (job seekers)
- Knowledge Pro: $29/mo (developers/power users)

**Evidence:**
- Van Westendorp: $10-15 rated "good value" ✅
- Token cost: $0.19 → 98% margin at $12/mo ✅
- Focus groups: $79 lifetime called "no-brainer" ✅

### 2. Lifetime Unlimited is Risky for High-Volume Users ⚠️

**Problem:**
- Recruiter generating 10 CVs/week = profitable for 10 months, then loss
- Break-even: 411 CVs (unrealistic for individual, trivial for business)

**Solutions:**
- Option A: Cap lifetime at 12 CVs/year + $8/extra (SaaS Expert)
- Option B: Remove lifetime, annual only (Freemium Growth)
- Option C: Usage-based credit packs (Usage-Based Specialist)
- Option D: Keep lifetime for B2C, switch to per-seat + per-CV for B2B (B2B/Enterprise)

**Consensus:** Keep lifetime for Stage 1 validation (B2C), but add caps or switch to annual/usage-based for B2B.

### 3. Missing Tiers Identified 🔍

**All groups agree these are missing:**

1. **Starter Tier ($19 one-time):** Lower barrier than $79 lifetime
2. **Knowledge Pro Lifetime ($199):** Focus groups explicitly requested this
3. **Team Plan ($199-399/mo):** B2B entry point without enterprise complexity
4. **Academic Tier ($15/mo):** Student/researcher segment (50% off)

### 4. Self-Hosted Pricing is Backwards 🔄

**Current:** $59/mo (more than cloud $29/mo)
**Fix:** $249 one-time + optional $99/yr support

**Reasoning:** Users hosting it themselves provide compute → should pay less over time, not more

### 5. Annual Discounts Should Be 15-20% 💰

**Standard:** 2 months free = 16.7% discount
**Reasoning:** HubSpot, Slack, Salesforce all use this range
**Psychology:** "2 months free" sounds better than "16.7% off"

---

## Key Disagreements: Where Groups Differ

### Disagreement 1: Free Tier Strategy

**Bootstrapper (Group 1):** ❌ No free tier until Stage 2
- Reasoning: Free users cost $0.19 + support burden, pollution signals
- Recommendation: Skip free, launch at $9-12 paid

**SaaS Expert (Group 2), Freemium (Group 4), B2B (Group 5):** ✅ Keep free tier
- Reasoning: Lead generation, virality, bottom-up adoption
- Recommendation: 1 CV free, optimize for 8-12% conversion

**Synthesis:** Keep free tier (3 out of 5 recommend it), but set aggressive conversion targets (8-12%) to offset CAC.

---

### Disagreement 2: Subscription vs One-Time

**Bootstrapper (Group 1):** One-time > subscriptions early
- Reasoning: No churn management, faster to revenue
- Recommendation: $9-29 one-time for Stage 1

**SaaS Expert (Group 2), Freemium (Group 4):** Subscriptions + one-time hybrid
- Reasoning: Subscriptions = predictable revenue, one-time = acquisition
- Recommendation: Offer both ($12/mo OR $79 one-time)

**Usage-Based (Group 3):** Credit packs (neither subscription nor pure one-time)
- Reasoning: Fairest model, scales naturally
- Recommendation: 10 credits for $79, 100 for $599, etc.

**Synthesis:** Offer both subscription ($12/mo) and one-time ($79) for Stage 1. Test which converts better. Add credit packs in Stage 2-3 for B2B.

---

### Disagreement 3: Complexity vs Simplicity

**Bootstrapper (Group 1):** Radical simplicity
- 1 SKU, 1 price, 1 promise
- No tiers, no comparisons
- Launch in 48 hours

**SaaS Expert (Group 2), Usage-Based (Group 3), B2B (Group 5):** Sophisticated tiers
- 4-6 tiers (Free, Starter, Pro, Power, Team, Enterprise)
- Usage-based or per-seat pricing
- Annual vs monthly options

**Synthesis:** Start simple (Stage 1: Free + $12 one-time), add tiers progressively (Stage 2: + Starter $19, Stage 3: + Team $199, Year 2: + Enterprise custom).

---

## Phased Rollout Plan: Synthesized Roadmap

### Stage 1 (Weeks 1-3): Launch - Bootstrapper Approach

**Goal:** First 10-20 paying customers, validate core value prop

**Pricing:**
```
🆓 Free: 1 CV (no credit card)
🔥 Launch Special: $12 one-time (first 50 customers get lifetime updates)
📈 Regular: $19/mo after 50 customers
```

**Why this:**
- Simplest possible (1 paid SKU)
- Creates urgency (first 50 special)
- Validates willingness to pay
- Bootstrapper speed (launch in 48 hours)

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't build team features yet
- ❌ Don't add complex tiers
- ❌ Don't launch credit packs
- ❌ Don't hire sales team

**Success metric:** 10-20 customers paying $12-19 in 3 weeks

---

### Stage 2 (Weeks 4-8): Expand - SaaS Expert + Freemium Adjustments

**Goal:** 50-100 paying customers, test tier structure

**Add these tiers:**

1. **Starter: $19 one-time** (3 CVs)
   - Lower barrier than $79 lifetime
   - Test: Do more people choose $19 or jump to $79?

2. **Knowledge Pro Lifetime: $199**
   - Fill gap from focus group feedback
   - Test: What % choose lifetime vs $29/mo?

3. **Academic: $15/mo** (.edu email)
   - Capture student segment
   - Test: Do students convert at higher rate?

**Updated structure:**
```
Free → Starter ($19) → CV Pro ($12/mo or $79 life) → Knowledge Pro ($29/mo or $199 life) → Academic ($15/mo)
```

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't add Team or Enterprise yet

## Conclusion: The Optimal Path Forward

### The Synthesis

After analyzing 5 expert perspectives (16,000+ words of strategy), the optimal pricing approach is:

**Start simple (Bootstrapper), expand strategically (SaaS Expert + Freemium), scale to B2B (Usage-Based + Enterprise).**

### Stage 1: Bootstrapper Speed (Weeks 1-3)
- Launch at $12 one-time (first 50 customers)
- Free tier: 1 CV
- Goal: Validate willingness to pay in 48 hours
- Success: 10-20 paying customers

### Stage 2: Add Strategic Tiers (Months 2-3)
- Starter: $19 one-time (lower barrier)
- Knowledge Pro Lifetime: $199 (fill focus group gap)
- Academic: $15/mo (student segment)
- Goal: 50-100 paying customers, 8-12% conversion

### Stage 3: Team Plans (Months 4-6)
- Team: $199/mo (5 users, 50 CVs)
- Self-serve + light touch sales
- Goal: First 10 team customers

### Stage 4: Credit Packs + Enterprise (Months 6-12)
- Credit packs: $79-2,499 (usage-based for high-volume)
- Enterprise: $1,500+/mo custom (SSO, API, white-label)
- Goal: First 5 enterprise deals

### Year 2+: Scale Enterprise
- 20-50 enterprise customers
- Hire sales team (2-3 reps)
- Revenue: $1M-6M ARR (80% from enterprise)

### The Math Works

| Customer Type | Annual Value | Margin | Revenue Potential (Year 5) |
|---------------|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| B2C (5,000 users) | $35 avg | 98% | $175K (lead gen engine) |
| Teams (150 customers) | $3,500 avg | 93% | $525K (self-serve growth) |
| Enterprise (75 customers) | $42,000 avg | 97% | $3,150K (revenue engine) |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$3,850K** |

### Your Competitive Advantages

1. **Token costs ($0.19/CV):** 97-98% margins at all price points
2. **Interview depth:** Competitors use templates (shallow), you extract knowledge (deep)
3. **MCP integration:** First-mover in AI memory for job search/career use case
4. **Dual value prop:** CV generation (B2C, transactional) + AI memory (power users, recurring)

### What Makes This Different

Most B2B SaaS:
- Start B2B → try to add B2C later (hard)
- Optimize for enterprise from day 1 (slow)

Your path:
- Start B2C → expand to B2B (natural)
- Optimize for speed → add sophistication (fast validation)

### Start Tomorrow

**Day 1 actions:**
1. Deploy landing page (Free + $12 paid)
2. Set up Polar.sh
3. Post on Reddit (r/resumes, r/ClaudeAI)
4. Get first paying customer

Everything else builds from this foundation.
